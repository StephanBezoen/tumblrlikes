    <string name="introduction">This app allows you to view liked photo posts of a single Tumblr blog offline.
        \n\n
        The first time this app runs, it will retrieve all liked posts from the blog you have specified. Once they have been downloaded, you can view the posts as full screen images.
        \n\n
        In the background, all photos are downloaded and cached at their highest resolution. Please be aware that this may take considerable storage space on your device.
        \n\n
        Liked posts are synchronized once a day.
